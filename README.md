# Hacker's Rest

These are my publicly accessible notes from various sources for penetration testing, red-teaming, OSCP, Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, and my [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)/ [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu) machine [write-ups](https://zweilosec.github.io/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning - These notes are largely unformatted right now. They are based on my way of learning things - by reading, doing, studying, exploring, and taking notes. Cleaning up and formatting comes later.

* Do not assume anything from these notes.
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive, or to cover the techniques or the output they produce in full.
* Expect mistakes in the notes.
* Feel free to ask questions!
* Always consult additional resources. If possible I will try to link to outside resources. _If I have shared something of yours and you want credit, please let me know!_

## Contribution

**If you would like to add to, modify, or improve anything in my notes, PLEASE DO!**

If you would like to give suggestions or even commit changes to these pages feel free to head to my GitHub page at:

### How to contribute

1. [Create an Issue Request](https://github.com/zweilosec/Infosec-Notes/issues) describing your changes/additions.
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/zweilosec/Infosec-Notes).
3. Push some code to your fork.
4. Come back to this repository and [open a pull request](https://github.com/zweilosec/Infosec-Notes/pulls).
5. After reviewing your changes, I will merge your pull request to the master repository.
6. Make sure to update your Issue Request so that I can credit you! Thank you so much!

Feel free to also open an issue with any questions, help wanted, or requests! Throughout these notes I have put `TODO:` notes that indicate that I know a certain section needs work. Focus on these if you can!

```bash
TODO: Change all code examples to use variables (e.g. $host_ip)
rather than fill-in-the-blank format (e.g. <host_ip>). 
This will help greatly with copying code directly into scripts.
```

## Contents

The following sub-pages of these notes will explore some of the common offensive and defensive security techniques including gaining shells, code execution, lateral movement, persistence, scripting, tools and much more. I also cover techniques for dealing with CTF-type challenges such as cryptography, reverse engineering, steganography and more.

{% hint style="success" %}
Hack Responsibly.

Always ensure you have **explicit** permission to access any computer system **before** using any of the techniques contained in these documents. You accept full responsibility for your actions by applying any knowledge gained here.
