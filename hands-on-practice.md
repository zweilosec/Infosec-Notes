| [https://247ctf.com/](https://247ctf.com/) | Challenge instances are directly accessible from the platform; no VPN or complicated setups are required. Rather than sharing challenges, every player controls their own unique instance. You can start, stop and restart your challenges at any time. |
| [https://ctftime.org/](https://ctftime.org/) |  There are a lot of Capture The Flag \(CTF\) competitions in our days, some of them have excellent tasks, but in most cases they're forgotten just after the CTF finished. We decided to make some kind of CTF archive and of course, it'll be too boring to have just an archive, so we made a place, where you can get some another CTF-related info - current overall Capture The Flag team [rating](https://ctftime.org/rating-formula/), per-team statistics etc |
| [http://overthewire.org/wargames/](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) | The wargames offered by the OverTheWire community can help you to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games. |
| [https://overthewire.org/warzone/](https://overthewire.org/warzone/) | The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 Internet, on which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike other wargames, the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP. |
| [https://www.underthewire.tech/](https://www.underthewire.tech/) | Under the Wire trains experienced, developing, and novice Information Technologists to use Windows PowerShell in a variety of situations through innovative and fun wargames. |
| [https://w3challs.com/](https://w3challs.com/) | Our community offers you security challenges to learn and practice hacking. Our goal is to provide fun and unique challenges running in a real world environment, with **no guessing** and **no simulation**! Our challenges address several subsets of hacking, mostly oriented on the offensive. A multitude of technologies and architectures are waiting for you. Show us your mad skillz and pop some shells \(or calcs\)! |
